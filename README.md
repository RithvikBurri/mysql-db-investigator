# Database Investigator
Interactive Python-based MySQL database search engine that dynamically explores unknown schemas and performs intelligent keyword searches across all tables and columns. Enables users to uncover relevant records without needing prior knowledge of the database structure.

## Purpose
Demonstrates practical skills in MySQL integration, automated schema discovery, and interactive search algorithms. This tool is valuable for developers, analysts, and administrators working with unfamiliar or complex relational databases.

## Skills Learned
Throughout the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience and strengthened my skills in:

* **Database Management:** MySQL connections, schema discovery, and query generation  
* **Python Programming:** Modular design and interactive CLI applications  
* **Dynamic Schema Analysis:** Automated table/column mapping across database structures  
* **Search Algorithm Development:** Flexible keyword-based search using LIKE queries  
* **Error Handling & Resilience:** Graceful handling of unsupported types and query failures  
* **User Experience Design:** Clear prompts, informative feedback, and result displays  
* **Tool Adaptability:** Universal design for any MySQL database structure
