# MySQL DB Investigator
Interactive Python-based MySQL database search engine that dynamically explores unknown schemas and performs intelligent keyword searches across all tables and columns. Enables users to uncover relevant records without needing prior knowledge of the database structure.

## Purpose
Demonstrates practical skills in MySQL integration, automated schema discovery, and interactive search algorithms. This tool is valuable for developers, analysts, and administrators working with unfamiliar or complex relational databases.

## Skills Learned
Throughout the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience and strengthened my skills in:

* **Database Management:** MySQL connections, dynamic schema discovery, and adaptive query generation
* **Python Programming:** Modular function design, interactive command-line applications, and real-time user interaction
* **Dynamic Schema Analysis:** Automated table listing, column retrieval, and universal database structure mapping
* **Search Algorithm Development:** Flexible keyword-based search implementation across multiple tables using `LIKE` queries
* **Error Handling & Resilience:** Graceful handling of unsupported column types (BLOBs) and query failure prevention
* **User Experience Design:** Interactive CLI with clear prompts, informative feedback, and conditional result displays
* **Tool Adaptability:** Universal design approach enabling compatibility with any MySQL database structure or content
